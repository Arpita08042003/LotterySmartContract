Lottery Smart Contract
: This is my first solidity smart contract.
In this, there are two users, and
one is the manager who will deploy the lottery, in other words, start the lottery round. 
And another is a player who will pay some ether and get a lottery ticket if once they buy one lottery, they can't buy another. 
The manager can't buy lottery tickets. 
The winner will be selected by generating a random number, and only the manager can generate a random number. 
After generating the random number, no one can buy any ticket.
